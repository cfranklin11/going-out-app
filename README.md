# Technologies used:
- ALT React library: Alt is a library that facilitates the managing of state within your JavaScript applications. It is modeled after flux.

- react-rails: Ruby gem for automatically transforming JSX and using React in Rails. (https://github.com/reactjs/react-rails)

- browserify: for bundling up all dependencies.

- Babel:  compiler for writing next generation JavaScript. (compiling from ES6 to ES5) When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, it will help you compile it down to a supported version. (https://github.com/babel/babel)

- Babel presets that we are using:

  - "babel-preset-es2015": compiles ES2015 to ES5

  - "babel-preset-react": transform JSX into createElement calls.

# Front-end sources used:

* React State management: alt (alt.js.org)
* Css Grid system: FlexBox (http://flexgrid.axiomzen.co/)
